</p>

Understood the difference between:
- **Admin Panel:** for system configuration and settings  
- **Agent Panel:** for handling and managing support tickets  

---

### Step 2: Configure Roles
<p align="center">
  <img src="./roles.png" alt="osTicket Roles Configuration" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Path:** Admin Panel → Agents → Roles  

Created a new role called **Supreme Admin**, granting full permissions for ticket management, configuration, and system settings.  
This role allows top-level administrative control over all osTicket features.

---

### Step 3: Configure Departments
<p align="center">
  <img src="./departments.png" alt="osTicket Departments Configuration" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Path:** Admin Panel → Agents → Departments  

Added a department named **SysAdmins** to handle technical and backend issues.  
Departments determine ticket visibility and workflow, such as separating **Help Desk**, **SysAdmins**, and **Networking** responsibilities.

---

### Step 4: Configure Teams
<p align="center">
  <img src="./teams.png" alt="osTicket Teams Configuration" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Path:** Admin Panel → Agents → Teams  

Created a **Team** named **Online Banking** to pull agents from multiple departments.  
Teams improve collaboration across different technical groups and allow shared ticket responsibilities.

---

### Step 5: Configure User Settings
<p align="center">
  <img src="./user-settings.png" alt="osTicket User Settings" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Path:** Admin Panel → Settings → User Settings  

Updated registration settings to:
- **Require registration and login** to create tickets  
- **Unchecked** the option allowing unregistered users to create tickets  

This ensures only verified users can submit support requests.

---

### Step 6: Configure Agents (Support Staff)
<p align="center">
  <img src="./agents.png" alt="osTicket Agents Configuration" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Path:** Admin Panel → Agents → Add New  

Created the following agents:  
- **Jane** — Assigned to **SysAdmins Department**  
- **John** — Assigned to **Support Department**  

Agents represent internal IT staff responsible for resolving tickets.

---

### Step 7: Configure Users (End Users)
<p align="center">
  <img src="./users.png" alt="osTicket Users Configuration" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Path:** Agent Panel → Users → Add New  

Added two users (customers):  
- **Karen**  
- **Ken**  

End users submit tickets via the user portal and receive responses from agents.

---

### Step 8: Configure SLA Plans
<p align="center">
  <img src="./sla.png" alt="osTicket SLA Configuration" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Path:** Admin Panel → Manage → SLA  

Configured three SLA plans to manage response and resolution expectations:

| SLA Plan | Grace Period | Schedule |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Sev-A | 1 hour | 24/7 |
| Sev-B | 4 hours | 24/7 |
| Sev-C | 8 hours | Business Hours |

SLAs ensure timely support based on ticket priority.

---

### Step 9: Configure Help Topics
<p align="center">
  <img src="./helptopics.png" alt="osTicket Help Topics Configuration" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Path:** Admin Panel → Manage → Help Topics  

Created Help Topics to categorize tickets:
- Business Critical Outage  
- Personal Computer Issues  
- Equipment Request  
- Password Reset  
- Other  

These topics route tickets to the appropriate departments or teams automatically.

---

### 🧹 Disk Sanitization
After completing the configuration, the Azure virtual machine was deleted to ensure all temporary data and credentials were securely removed.

## 🧾 Summary

This lab completed the **post-install configuration** of osTicket, transforming it into a fully operational help desk system.  
By configuring users, SLAs, roles, and ticket topics, this project demonstrates the ability to manage IT service environments and implement workflow automation within an enterprise support system.
